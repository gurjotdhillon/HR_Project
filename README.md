# Employee Analytics SQL Project

This project contains a full SQL-based analysis of a fictional company database including employees, departments, projects, employee project hours, and performance reviews.  
All queries were written in PostgreSQL.

## 📂 Project Structure

## 📘 Objective

The goal of this project was to explore real-world SQL analytical patterns such as:
- Window functions  
- Aggregations  
- Ranking  
- Percentiles  
- Subqueries & CTEs  
- Joining multiple related tables  
- Department-level and company-level insights  

The queries answer common business intelligence questions such as:
- Which employees work on the most projects?
- Which departments have the highest workload?
- Who earns above/below department or company benchmarks?
- Which employees contribute to the largest projects?
- Which departments score highest in performance?

## 🧪 Technologies Used
- **PostgreSQL 14+**
- SQL Window Functions  
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

## 🗃️ Database Tables
The database consists of:
- `employees`
- `departments`
- `projects`
- `employee_projects`
- `performance_reviews`

## 📑 Included SQL Queries
The main script includes:
- Salary analytics  
- Performance review trends  
- Project workload calculations  
- Department productivity metrics  
- Employee percentile ranking  
- Largest project analysis  
- Employees working across departments  
- Employees working on all projects within their department
